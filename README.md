# Towards a Formal Model of Nonsuicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) 
### Sayo Stefflbauer (2025)
This repository includes the code for a preliminary computational model of NSSI and code to simulate behaviour that follows from this model. 

`Functional_Forms.R` contains the equation and visualization for the functional form between U and A. Parameter values are varied to visualize their effects on the sigmoidal shape.  
`Default_Values.R` contains the default starting values and default parameter models for all model equations.  
`Differential_Equations.R` contains all differential equations used in the computational model.  
`Simulation_Function.R` contains the preliminary computational model of NSSI, i.e. formalized causal loop diagram.  
`Test_and_Plot_Simulation.R` contains the code to test and plot the simulation output.
