# Towards a Formal Model of Nonsuicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) 
### Sayo Stefflbauer (2025)
This repository includes the code for a preliminary computational model of NSSI and code to simulate behaviour that follows from this model. 

[Simulation.R]

Simulation.R contains the preliminary computational model of NSSI, i.e. formalized causal loop diagram.
Default_Values.R contains the default starting values and default parameter models for all model equations.
Differential_Equations.R contains all differential equations used in the computational model.
